## Objectives
* Teach #ASKnet community new skills which help enable women empowerment and support  to build networks in their communities.
* Provide participants with concrete strategies and tools for creating inclusive spaces for women.
* Discuss best practices for maintaining women's participation in media activities and workshops.

## Co-Creation of Key Questions for Empowering Women and Building Inclusive Spaces

During this session, a collaborative process will be employed to generate three key questions: 'What,' 'Why,' and 'How.' The session will delve into the 'what,' focusing on the core content or subject matter. It will address the 'why' to emphasize the significance and relevance of this content. Most importantly, the primary focus will be on sharing the 'how,' offering concrete strategies and actionable steps to empower and support women within their communities and facilitate the creation of inclusive spaces.

### The What?

## Inequality Triangle

Inclusion inherently entails providing access and opportunities. In various programs and projects, the aspiration is always to maximize inclusion. However, the absence of the necessary expertise can often lead to challenges. This is where the Gender Inequality Triangle tool comes into play, offering a solution to "The How?", to bridge the gap and enhance inclusivity.

  <em>The Inequality Triangle</em></p>

It consist of three sites and has four simple steps that one can take.

**1. Scan:**  
   Scan the room to ensure representativeness. Look around to check if we are all here (this creates self-awareness).  
   "Is everyone here? Are we all represented?"  
   "Do we have women from minority / ethnicity groups? Are they represented?"

**2. Awareness:**  
   1.  Create corporate awareness (the fact that you know that not everyone is represented does not mean that the next person is aware). You do this by asking the next person if we are all represented.  
   "Neighbour are you aware that not everyone is represented? There are people who are missing." 

   2. Come up with solutions to address gender inequality.  
   "Ask your employee to reach out to people who aren`t part of the program / course / etc. yet." 
     
**3. Solutioning:**   
   Actioning - actually putting the solutions into actions.  
    “Finding a hundred solutions and implementing none is an exercise in futility” (Warren Buffett)

  <em>Community of Practice</em></p>

A Community of Practice comprises three essential elements:

* **Domain:**  
  This involves a group of individuals sharing a common interest. For instance, consider fans of the English football club Liverpool. These fans, easily identified by their red jerseys, unite under the hashtag #ynwa (acronym for "you never walk alone") on social media.

* **Community:**  
  This represents a group of individuals with a shared objective of improvement, exemplified by groups like #ASKnet.

* **Practice:**  
  Within this community, there exists an opportunity for individuals to exchange experiences.

To enhance participation in a Community of Practice, the following toolbox elements should be applied: 
* Individual / Institutional Brainstorming from lived experiences
* Community Sharing – Case Studies and Scenarios
* Collecting and collating experiences 
* Expert Guidance / Intervention
* ToolBox Development + Additional Resources

## #ASKnet Toolbox of Inclusivity Tools:

The following tool box was developed within a [**role play**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f47hwvAgxeE) (starting at 19:10 min.) during the webinar.

 CHALLENGE    | SOLUTION | PRACTICAL STEPS |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
|  Women have no access to  meeting places. | Meet where many of them are already gathered. | Secure an already available host/ess in the community. Go to places women fetch water, do laundry. |
| Resources / funding is scarce. | Accept in kind donations. Work with community based  partners. | Openly request for venues, stationery, refreshments, internet,  equipment. Partner with other organizations|
| Women cannot attend events due to socialization of community. | Let community leader open  doors for you. | Lobby existing community leaders. |
| Women attend once and do not return. | Follow up and send home material. Co-create content with participants. | Use sign in details to contact them. Develop a buddy system so they  can be accountable and supported. Print material for home activities. Offer hybrid sessions – in person and online. Allow community members to lead  some sessions. |
