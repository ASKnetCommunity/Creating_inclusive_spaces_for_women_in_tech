## Co-Creation of Key Questions for Empowering Women and Building Inclusive Spaces

During this session, a collaborative process will be employed to generate three key questions: 'What,' 'Why,' and 'How.' The session will delve into the 'what,' focusing on the core content or subject matter. It will address the 'why' to emphasize the significance and relevance of this content. Most importantly, the primary focus will be on sharing the 'how,' offering concrete strategies and actionable steps to empower and support women within their communities and facilitate the creation of inclusive spaces.

## Inequality Triangle

Inclusion inherently entails providing access and opportunities. In various programs and projects, the aspiration is always to maximize inclusion. However, the absence of the necessary expertise can often lead to challenges. This is where the Gender Inequality Triangle tool comes into play, offering a solution to bridge the gap and enhance inclusivity.

It consist of three sites and has four simple steps that one can take.

**1. Scan:**  
   Scan the the room/ to ensure representativeness. Look around to check if we are all here (this creates self-awareness).  
   "Is everyone here? Are we all represented?"
   "Do we have women from minority / ethnicity groups? Are they represented?"

**2. Awarenss:**  
   1.  Create corporate awareness (the fact that you know that not everyone is represented does not mean that the next person is aware). You do this by asking the next person if we are all represented.  
   "Neighbor are you aware that not everyone is here? There are people who are missing." 

   2. Come up with solutions to address gender inequality.  
   "Ask your employee to reach out to people who aren`t part of the program / course / etc. yet." 
     
**3. Solutioning:**   
   Actioning - actually putting the solutions into actions.
    “Finding a hundred solutions and implementing none is an exercise in futility” (Warren Buffett)
